Drawbacks of XOR linked List:

An XOR linked list is similar to a doublylinked list but not completely equivalent to a doublylinked list. There are several disadvantages of an XOR linked list over a doubly-linked list, which is discussed below: 
1. A doubly-inked list is easy to code and maintain, but it is a little complex for an XOP linked list. 
2. XOR linked list is not supported by several languages such as Java, where conversion between pointers and integers is undefined. 
3. If a pointer to an existing middle node in an XOR linked list is provided, we can't delete that node from the list or insert a new node before or after it. On the other hand, this can be done easily with a doubly-linked
